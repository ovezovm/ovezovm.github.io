      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;horses-majestic-and-faithful-companions-of-man&#34;&gt;Horses. Majestic and Faithful Companions of Man&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses are not just animals, they have played a key role in the development of human civilization for thousands of years. These majestic creatures, possessing strength, grace and nobility, accompanied us in wars, agriculture and travel. In this post, we will talk in more detail about horses: their history, breeds, behavioral characteristics and meaning for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-history-of-horses-from-wild-herds-to-domestic-helpers&#34;&gt;The history of horses. From wild herds to domestic helpers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic horses (Equus ferus caballus) are descended from wild ancestors such as Przewalski&amp;rsquo;s wild horse, the only species of wild horses that has survived to the present day. The domestication of horses began about 4-5 thousand years ago on the steppes of Eurasia. Since then, horses have become the most important companions of man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ancient times, they were used for transportation, plowing and transporting goods. Later, they became indispensable in military campaigns: light and fast, they allowed riders to move with incredible speed, providing an advantage on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;horses-in-culture-and-mythology&#34;&gt;Horses in culture and mythology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In various cultures, the horse symbolized strength, freedom and courage. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ancient Greece, horses were companions of the gods. The legendary horses of Poseidon and Pegasus are examples of divine beings with qualities attributed to horses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Norse mythology, Sleipnir, Odin&amp;rsquo;s eight-legged horse, was a symbol of speed and power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ancient Indian texts, the horse Ashwa was revered as a sacred animal associated with the sun and vital energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;horse-breeds-the-diversity-of-beauty-and-power&#34;&gt;Horse breeds. The diversity of beauty and power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more than 300 horse breeds, and each of them has its own characteristics that make them unique. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some of the most famous and popular breeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###1. Arabian Horse
One of the most ancient and recognizable breeds, the Arabian horse is distinguished by its elegance, endurance and proud appearance. She is easily recognized by her graceful head and high tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent endurance and speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often used in equestrian and horse racing competitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###2. Thoroughbred English horse
This breed, bred for racing, is known for its incredible speed and agility. Thoroughbred horses are real athletes participating in the largest horse races in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They often participate in endurance sports and horse racing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###3. The Frisian horse
Frisian horses are famous for their black color and long mane. It is one of the oldest breeds in Europe, distinguished by both power and elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High endurance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used in sledges and parades, as well as in shows and movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;physical-characteristics-and-behavior&#34;&gt;Physical characteristics and behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses are gregarious, social and very intelligent animals. In nature, they live in groups with a certain hierarchy, where the older stallion and the leading mare play the main roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vision&#34;&gt;Vision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses have widely spaced eyes, which allows them to see almost 360 degrees around. However, they have a &amp;ldquo;blind spot&amp;rdquo; in front of their nose, which they compensate for with a movable neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;communication&#34;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses communicate with both sounds and gestures. For example, they can neigh, knock with a hoof, and actively use facial expressions of ears and eyes to express emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-role-of-horses-in-the-modern-world&#34;&gt;The role of horses in the modern world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the development of technology, horses continue to play an important role in human life. Here are a few areas where horses remain indispensable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###1. Sports and leisure
Equestrian sports are one of the most popular forms of human–horse interaction. Sports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horse racing is one of the oldest sports competitions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-therapy-and-rehabilitation&#34;&gt;2. Therapy and rehabilitation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippotherapy (treatment with horses) It is actively used for the rehabilitation of people with physical and psychological problems. Horse movements have a positive effect on human muscles, and an emotional connection with an animal helps to overcome fears and stress.
###3. Work and Agriculture
In some parts of the world, horses continue to be used for transporting goods, plowing land and other agricultural work. This is especially true in remote mountainous or rural areas, where technology is not always available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;horse-care&#34;&gt;Horse care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses require daily care, and it&amp;rsquo;s not just about feeding or cleaning. Here are a few aspects that are important for the health and happiness of a horse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-proper-nutrition&#34;&gt;1. Proper nutrition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses are herbivores and their diet mainly consists of hay and grass. Access to clean water is also important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###2. Hoof cleaning and Health
Regular cleaning helps to avoid skin diseases, and hoof care prevents their deformities and infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-vaccination-and-veterinary-care&#34;&gt;3. Vaccination and veterinary care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses need regular vaccinations and checkups by a veterinarian to prevent diseases and monitor their overall health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Markdown Markup Language</title>
      <link>https://ovezovm.github.io/post/post-na-vibor-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ovezovm.github.io/post/post-na-vibor-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;markdown-markup-language&#34;&gt;Markdown Markup Language&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a simple and easy-to-use markup language that allows you to quickly and easily format text for publication on the internet. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz to simplify the process of writing and reading text in HTML format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantages-of-markdown&#34;&gt;Advantages of Markdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main advantage of Markdown is its simplicity and readability. Unlike HTML, where tags are used to format text, Markdown uses simple and intuitive symbols. For example, to italicize text, you need to surround it with asterisks (*), and to bold it, you need to use double asterisks (**). This makes text written with Markdown easy to read even in its raw form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of Markdown is its versatility. Many platforms and services, such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, Reddit and many others, support Markdown. This means you can use the same format to write documentation, articles, comments, and other types of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-markdown-elements&#34;&gt;Basic Markdown Elements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some basic elements you can use in Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headings: Use the # symbol to create headings of different levels (# for H1, ## for H2, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists: Use - or * symbols to create unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links: Use square brackets for link text and parentheses for URL (e.g., 
)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images: Use an exclamation mark, square brackets for alternate text, and parentheses for the image URL (e.g., 















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt Text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quotes: Use the &amp;gt; symbol to create quote blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code: Use backticks (`) to highlight inline code and triple backticks (```) for code blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a powerful and easy-to-use markup language that can significantly simplify the process of creating content for web publications. Due to its readability and versatility, Markdown has become one of the most popular formats for writing documentation, articles, and other types of content on the internet. By mastering the basics of Markdown, you can quickly and efficiently create high-quality content for your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ovezovm.github.io/post/post-na-vibor-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;version-control-with-git&#34;&gt;Version Control with Git&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a distributed version control system that has become an indispensable tool for software developers. It allows you to effectively manage code changes, collaborate with other developers, and track the history of your project. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore the key concepts and commands of Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-concepts-of-git&#34;&gt;Key Concepts of Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repository - This is a storage place for your project, containing all files and change history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit represents a snapshot of the project&amp;rsquo;s state at a particular point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and a message describing the changes made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branch is an independent line of development in the repository. It allows you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This allows you to integrate new features or fixes into the main branch of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-git-commands&#34;&gt;Key Git Commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git init&lt;/strong&gt;: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git clone&lt;/strong&gt;: Clones an existing repository to your local machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git add&lt;/strong&gt;: Adds changes to the index for subsequent commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git commit&lt;/strong&gt;: Creates a new commit with added changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git status&lt;/strong&gt;: Displays the current state of the repository, showing changed, added, and deleted files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git branch&lt;/strong&gt;: Manages branches, allowing you to create, delete, and switch between branches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git merge&lt;/strong&gt;: Merges changes from one branch into the current branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git pull&lt;/strong&gt;: Downloads changes from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git push&lt;/strong&gt;: Sends local commits to the remote repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits-of-using-git&#34;&gt;Benefits of Using Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versioning: Git allows you to save the history of changes, making it easier to track and revert to previous versions of the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration: Git simplifies collaboration on a project, allowing multiple developers to work in parallel and merge their changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branching: Branches in Git provide flexibility and isolation when developing new features or fixing bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution: Git is a distributed system, which means that every developer has a full copy of the repository and can work autonomously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a powerful tool that significantly simplifies version control and collaboration on projects. By mastering the key concepts and commands of Git, you can effectively control changes in your code and collaborate with other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
